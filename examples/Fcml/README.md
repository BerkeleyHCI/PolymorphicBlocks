Potential improvements for v2
- Converter in connectors: rotated 90 degrees, balanced lengths to V+ and V-
- Bootstrap diodes: rotated 90 so they're not protruding into the converter power path pour
- Maybe move decoupling caps closer to FPGA and MCU
- Decoupling cap 1uF on USB Vbus line, as transient suppression
